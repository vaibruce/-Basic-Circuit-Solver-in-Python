# Basic-Circuit-Solver-in-Python
## Overview
This Python command-line tool solves simple DC circuits using **Ohm’s Law**, **Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL)**, and **Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL)**. The program calculates the current through each branch and voltage drops across each resistor.

## Features
- Solves circuits with multiple resistors and voltage sources.
- Modular code for different components: Ohm's Law, KCL, and KVL.
- Unit tests for validation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `numpy` for solving linear equations.

### How to Run the Code
1. Install Python (if not already installed).
2. Run the program in any Python environment.
3. Use the unit tests to validate the correctness of each function.

## Downloading the code 
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vaibruce/Basic-Circuit-Solver-in-Python.git
cd Basic-Circuit-Solver-in-Python
