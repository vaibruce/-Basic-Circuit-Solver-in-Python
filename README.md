# -Basic-Circuit-Solver-in-Python
A Python program to solve simple DC circuits using Ohm’s law and Kirchhoff’s laws.

# DC Circuit Solver

## Overview
This Python command-line tool solves simple DC circuits using **Ohm’s Law**, **Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL)**, and **Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL)**. The program calculates the current through each branch and voltage drops across each resistor.

## Features
- Solves circuits with multiple resistors and voltage sources.
- Modular code for different components: Ohm's Law, KCL, and KVL.
- Unit tests for validation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `numpy` for solving linear equations.
